                    <p>My name is Rian Iskandar. I was born on 10 March 2001. I started having interest about computers at this age, a game called Minecraft is the reason behind it. From messing around with the game files to learn modifying contents of the game, I becoming more curious in how video games are being developed. Since then, I have a dream to become a programmer.</p>

                    <p>I am 16 years old at this point. I started to have interest in the world of smartphones and technologies. At this stage, I invest a lot on tech such as earphone and video games. I feel so much better at school as I started to adapt to the environment, but my grades at this point are falling apart especially in Accounts subject. I hate that subject most of the time. But still, I need to do something to achieve my dreams.</p>

To be honest, my secondary 5 was the best year ever!</p>
